\subsection{The omniscient controller}

The robot is moved following an optimal “omniscient” controller \cite{park2011smooth}. This controller has complete 
knowledge of the environment. Using the known poses of the robot and of the target object, the omniscient control moves 
the robot to the goal pose, as fast as possible. In particular, the controller checks if the euclidean distance from 
the goal is less than 1mm and if the robot orientation is less than 0.5 degrees from the goal orientation.
